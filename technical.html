<p><em><strong>samuel</strong> is a beat poetry generator I wrote in Perl for my "home page"
in 1997: the source code is <a href="https://github.com/spikelynch/samuel">on GitHub</a>. The only new feature is the permalink, which just reruns the poem with the same random seed. The paragraphs below are the original technical notes, dead links, extremely 90s earnestness and all.</em></p>

<hr />


<p><strong>samuel</strong> is a short program written in the
programming language Perl.  I thought I should say that to avoid
inadvertently deceiving anyone who's looking for actual information
about real human poets and who threw 'beat poetry' into a search
engine and ended up here.</p>

<p>If you're one of these people, or you like real Beats as well, try
<a href="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/Topics/BeatGen.html">this
informative site.</a></p>

<p>samuel works by generating basic sentences of the form</p>

<p><strong><tt>ARTICLE NOUN VERB ARTICLE NOUN</tt></strong></p> 

<p>The nouns can get slightly fancy, like</p>

<p><strong><tt>NOUN's ADJECTIVE NOUN</tt> or <tt>NOUN of ARTICLE
NOUN</tt></strong></p>

<p>The simple sentences then get glued together with conjunctions:</p>

<p><strong><tt>SENTENCE CONJUNCTION SENTENCE CONJUNCTION
SENTENCE...</tt></strong></p>

<p>Every so often, samuel will free associate, and sound like Rik from the Young Ones:</p>

<p><strong><tt>NOUN WORD WORD WORD WORD</tt></strong></p> 

<p>The actual words get picked randomly from lists.  samuel is not as
random as he could be: he has a tendency to use words he's already
used.</p>

<p>The great thing about generating beat poetry is that you can ignore
punctuation and throw line breaks in practically at random.</p>
