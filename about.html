<p>Of all the Beat poets, <strong>samuel</strong> remains the most
mysterious.  His date of birth, current whereabouts and even his
surname are all unknown.</p>

<p>samuel's poems have never been published in any formal sense of the
word.  He believed that the culture of the publishing world was
fatally toxic to the poetic spirit. Instead, his poems were delivered
to their audience by more personal and spontaneous methods.  Thus the
citizens of his native San Francisco could expect to find a samuel
pinned to their car windshield, scrawled on a men's room wall, tucked
into the lining of one of the coats cleaned at the Chinese laundry
which backed onto his favourite drinking alley, or, most likely,
screamed hoarsely at them while they rode on the city's famous trolley
cars.</p>

<p>Recently, however, a large collection of documents was discovered
in the trunk of a '57 Chevy in a wrecker's yard in Houston,
Texas. Scribbled onto countless paper napkins, laundry ticker stubs,
beer coasters, peeled-off wine labels and diner menus were literally
thousands of poems in samuel's inimitable style. It is with great
pride that <strong>Big Tank</strong> presents a small
selection from this great fountain of poetry.</p>
